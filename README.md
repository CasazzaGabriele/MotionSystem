 Project Overview 
</h2>

<p>
Hey everyone, 
I'm so happy to share with you a project i'm working on: a Parkour System made in Unreal Engine 5.3 

The Project I replicate the parkour movement of an athlete üèÉ.

Basically I've worked on the evaluation system of the character action, such as obstacles jumping, climbing, sliding and the motion system.

As you can see some animations are still not very accurate, it's a work in progress.
